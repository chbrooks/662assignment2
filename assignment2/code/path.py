### A Factory is a helper class that is used to create new Path objects.
### See http://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html for more details.
### It stores the graph representing our problem and uses it to find successors.

class PathFactory :
    def __init__(self, inputgraph) :
        self.inputgraph = inputgraph

    ### return a list of all paths that are successors to a given path
    ### you complete this. 
    ### For a given path, find the vertex in the input graph corresponding to its last element.
    ### Find the vertices it is connected to, and generate a path for each 
    ### one. Update cost to reflect the new edge added to the solution.

    def successors(self, path) :

        return successorList

### The path should store a list of vertices. This represents a partial solution. One example would be:
### ['GoldenGatePark', 'ChinaTown', 'CastroTheatre']
class Path :

    ## basic constructor. You will want to modify g and h. cost should be set by the factory.
    def __init__(self, vertex, parentPath=[]) :
        self.pathSoFar = parentPath + [vertex]
        self.g = 0
        self.h = 0
        self.cost = 0

    ### takes as input a function and evaluates that function on itself.
    def isGoal(self, goalTest) :
        return goalTest(self)

    def __repr__(self) :
        return self.pathSoFar.__repr__()

    def __hash__(self) :
        return self.pathSoFar.__hash__()

    ## you do this.
    def __lt__(self, other) :

    def __le__(self, other) :

    def __gt__(self, other) :

    def __ge__(self, other) :

    def __eq__(self, other) :

    def __ne__(self, other) :
            

### this is a helper function that takes a latitude or longitude string (such as "44.20.20W" and converts it to degrees

def convertDegree(str):
    deg, minutes, seconds = str.rstrip()[:-1].split('.', 2)
    minutes = float(minutes) + (float(seconds) / 60.0)
    deg = float(deg) + (minutes / 60.0)
    return deg
