### search takes as input a search queue, a path factory, a function that
### returns true if the state provided as input is the goal, and the maximum 
### depth to search in the search tree.
### Should print out the solution and the number of nodes enqueued, dequeued, 
###  and expanded.

def search(queue, initialState, factory, goalTest, maxdepth=10) :
    closedList = {}
    nodesEnqueued = 1
    nodesDequeued = 0
    nodesExpanded = 0
    queue.insert(initialState)
### you complete this. 
### While there are states in the queue,
###   1. Dequeue
###   2. If this is the goal, stop
###   3. If not, insert in the closed list and generate successors
###   4. If successors are not in the closed list, enqueue them.
